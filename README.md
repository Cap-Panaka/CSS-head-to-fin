# CSS-head-to-fin
One selector, one layout, and one slightly perplexed margin at a time—a dedicated hub where I record my journey of CSS learning. My notes, practice files, experiments, and "oops-that's-not-what-I-planned" moments are all collected in this repository, which is organized to develop consistent styling confidence.
